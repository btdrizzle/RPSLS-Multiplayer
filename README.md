# RPSLS-Multiplayer

The challenge of this project was not the functionality of the Rock,Paper,Scissors,Lizard,Spock game itself but connecting two users via a Firebase database for interactive play.  Two players can join the game at different locations and play!  There is also a chatbox so users who are not playing can interact.
